# dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles that is not expected to work on any others' computer.

## Things I use

[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) is a keyboard customizer for macOS. It is Powerful and Stable. But the advanced configuration is in JSON, making it quite verbose.

[Goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo) is a tool that manages Karabiner configuration with ease. It is written in Clojure and the configuration file is in Clojure edn format.

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation): Just for `CTRL-R` with super power.

[neovim](http://neovim.io): A bless to use with all the Lua, LSP, terminal support.

[alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty): Super fast terminal emulator.
